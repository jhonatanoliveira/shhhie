Additional information
----------------------

The Shhhie's project is something bigger but we had to start with this online chat idea and if the idea grows up we'll keep going with the second part of the project, a most audacious and promising one. So, now in this first step, I really need the people response to this new kind of chatting experience, then we'll gain motivation for the next one. Please, let me know any missing information, misunderstanding or doubts.  I'll be able to provide any information about our project, including technicals specifications and futures ideas.
